        <h3>How it started?</h3><br><br>
            <p> Three years ago, I started coding when I was in Grade 12 at La Consolacion University Philippines. 
                We had a programming subject where we used the C# language and skipped the c/c++ though I found it really helpful. 
                Of course, just like the other students, I had difficulty understanding the codes. 
                I remember during our first activity, I could not finish it because I had no idea how to print the sum.</p><br> <img src="./assets/LCUP.jpg" alt="LCUP" style="width:100%">

            <p>During my first year at Bulacan State University, 
                we started learning about the c++. It was easy for me since I already have some knowledge about programming from my previous year.
                 I was up-to-date with the lessons and able to answer the activities. </p>
                 <img src="./assets/BSU.jpg" alt="BSU" style="width:100%">

            <p>On my second year,
                we studied about JAVA language. And since they introduced the c# language to us initially, 
                i did not struggle adopting the new language since JAVA and C#  is similar.  <br><br>
                <img src="./assets/LANGUAGES.jpg" alt="BSU" style="width:100%">
           
                At the moment, I am learning about HTML and Css which is quite challenging. 
                Although,  I do not have any background about “markup text language” yet, 
                I am capable of creating any basic webpages through self study and by watching YouTube videos.</p>

            <h3>My First Game</h3><br><br>
            <p>One time, I saw my nephew playing Roblox and said “Is that it? Boring.”<br><br>
                I tried playing it once and unexpectedly enjoyed the game.
                I also found out that Roblox is like a game sharing community where heaps of people develop games and earn money from it. <br><br>

                An idea came to my mind … "what if I learn how to create a game on roblox?” 
                So, I started researching, watching on YouTube, and reading articles about it.</p><br><br>
               
                On the 12th of October 2021, at 6:52:03 AM 10/12/2021, I released my first game, an obby game.</p>
